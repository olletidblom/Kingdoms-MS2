## Setup: ##
	•	The game board consists of a 5x6 grid.
	•	Each player receives a set of castle tiles, numbered 1 through 4, representing the strength of their castles.
	•	Resource and hazard tiles, ranging from +6 to -6, are shuffled and placed face down.
  •	Each player draws one tile that they can look on, save, and choose to play whenever its their turn.

## Gameplay: ##
	•	Players take turns performing one of the following actions:
	•	Place a castle tile on an empty space on the board.
	•	Draw a tile from the stack and place it face up on an empty space.
	•	Special tiles include:
	•	Mountain: Divides the row and column it occupies into separate scoring sections.
	•	Dragon: Negates all positive resource tiles in its row and column.
	•	Gold Mine: Doubles the value of all tiles in its row and column.
	 
## Scoring: ##
	•	Once the board is filled, each row and column is scored.
	•	The value of each row and column is calculated by summing the values of the tiles, considering the effects of special tiles.
	•	Each player’s castle in a row or column multiplies the total value by the castle’s number (1 through 4).
	•	Players add or subtract points based on the placement of their castles relative to resource and hazard tiles.
	
## Rounds: ##
	•	After scoring, the board is cleared, and a new round begins.
	•	The game is played over three rounds, with scores accumulated across rounds.

## Winning the Game: ##
	•	The player with the highest total score after three rounds is declared the winner.
